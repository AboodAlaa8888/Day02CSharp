 Answer:
C# is considered managed code because it runs under the supervision of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which is part of the .NET framework.

The CLR provides services such as:

Automatic memory management (Garbage Collection)

Exception handling

Security enforcement

Type safety

Managed code means that the execution environment controls the program’s behavior and manages system resources, 
making the code safer and more stable compared to unmanaged code (like C or C++).

 Answer:
In C#, a struct is similar to a class in that both can:

Have fields, properties, methods, and constructors.

Be used to create custom data types.

However, there are key differences:

struct is a value type, while class is a reference type.

struct is stored on the stack, while class is stored on the heap.

struct does not support inheritance, but it can implement interfaces.

struct is usually used for lightweight objects that do not require complex behavior.

So when someone says “a struct is considered like a class before,” it means that struct has class-like capabilities,
 but is designed for simpler use cases with different memory and behavior characteristics.
